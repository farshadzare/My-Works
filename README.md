# GTFS Data
The GTFS format is an open and collaborative specification that aims to describe the main components of a public transport network.
Files in the GTFS Schedule format (from this point onwards referred to as GTFS) are also known as feeds. A feed is nothing more than a compressed .zip file that contains a set of tables, saved in separate .txt files, describing some aspects of the public transport network (stops/stations location, trip frequency, itineraries paths, etc). Just like in a relational database, tables in a feed have key columns that allow one to link information described in one table to the data described in another one.
